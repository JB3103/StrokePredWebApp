# StrokePredWebApp

This is the repository containing the final code files for the course Advanced Topics in CompSci CS 3002, by Jilin Stephen Biju. There are three folder, one called model+data containg the IPython notebook that contains the exploratory data analysis and the model training. The second folder is the frontend that contains the files for the frontend side, which was developed in NextJS, and was run using node. The third folder contains the backend, with the requirements file for the packages that is needed to run the backend.py file, which was made using Python 3.12.

The IPython notebook was developed in Google Colaboratory, and therefore would be best run there, or atleast in a Linux kernel because a package runs better in Linux. To download the dataset, you can give the following credentials when prompted, or you can make your own API key on Kaggle:
Username: jilinstephenbiju
API key:ceb6d800e68a2c91413a32161fd1af88

The other files were developed in a Windows 11 system, using Node 20.18.0 and NPM 10.9.0. The front end can be started in the local system using the command "npm run dev".
The backend can be started using "py backend.py".
